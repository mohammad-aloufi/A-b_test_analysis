# What's this?

This is a udacity project I finished. It's an A/B test analysis for an eCommerce company.

# project details

This company did an A/B test for their new and old page to see if the new page is better at atracting users or not.

My goal was to work through the notebook to help them understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Project result

The old page is better in the new one, and the people in the US are more likely to convert than the people in UK.
